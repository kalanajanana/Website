            <p><em>FNetball is one of the world's fastest growing participation sports. It was originally known as 'women's basketball' and was brought to England from America in the early 1900s. The game was first played on grass by women and was essentially the game we now know as netball. Today, the game is played on a hard court divided into thirds, with scoring rings at both ends but no 'backboard' to score off. The balls used are similar to basketball balls, but they are slightly lighter, smaller, and softer in construction. Netball is a non-contact sport in which players must be quick, strong, and agile. A game puts a lot of strain on the body, with players having to do short sprints, hard stops, and twists and turns throughout the game.

            <h3><b>History of Netball</b></h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p><em>Netball was invented in 1895 at Madame Ostenburg's College in England. Netball's popularity grew in the first half of the twentieth century, with the game being played in many British Commonwealth countries. There were no standard rules for both the nine-a-side and five-a-side versions of the game at the time.</em></p>

            <h3><b>Netball positions</b></h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p><em>The game is typically played by two teams of seven players, with the goal of outscoring the opponents. Each team member's position is clearly marked on their bib by an abbreviation. Each position in netball is highly specialized, serves a specific purpose, and is restricted to a specific area of the court. Before a point can be scored, the ball must be touched by a player in each third of the court on its way to the shooters.</em></p>
